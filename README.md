##Keyboard Shortcut Coach##

The idea for this tool is to sit in the background while a user browses the web and if keyboard shortcuts could be used, but aren't (for example, you click "archive" instead of pressing 'e'), then a reminder notification is prompted.

This is inspired by [KeyRocket for Gmail (tm)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyrocket-for-gmail/dmocchgkijnbjdjkmlglaemjhhdiobbp?hl=en]), but is extensible across multiple websites and ~~has~~ will have a slightly smarter algorithm for notifications to avoid "notification blindness".
